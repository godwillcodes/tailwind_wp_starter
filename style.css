Why don’t communists ever play cards?
Because they’re always trying to abolish the clubs.

What’s a communist’s favorite type of music?
Class-ical.

Why did the communist refuse to play hide and seek?
Because good comrades share everything—including their hiding spots.

Why was the communist always calm?
Because they had no private worries.
